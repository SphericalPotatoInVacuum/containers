# README

This repo hosts an assortment of container files I use.

## Notes

- The files for building the containers begin with `Containerfile` and may
  contain extensions to indicate whether it is a multistage build or not,
  among other stuff.
- The podman container tool is used to build and run the containers. If you
  are using some other tool, like docker, you may need to tweak the
  Containerfiles.
